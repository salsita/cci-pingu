// The task module holds the application logic, however is completely
// asynchronous and I/O heavy. In order to write proper unit tests, a lot of
// services would have to be mocked.
// ... I currently don't have time to do so, however, feel free to write the
// mocks and add missing unit tests, send the pull request, and I'll be more
// than happy to merge them in.
